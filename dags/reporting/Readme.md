# Refresh Reporting tables in the Data Warehouse
## Purpose
- Create standardized tables to see the data in Redshift
    - I used tables instead of views or materialized views for data persistence

## Views created
* How many contracts are signed each year with a socially dedicated (ESS, a sort of non-profit) company?
* Who are the biggest suppliers of the french state?
* How many contracts are signed each year and month? What is the seasonality of the data?
